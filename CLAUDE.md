# CLAUDE.md — cortex-pawline

> Two-tier visibility boundary inside this repo:
>
> - **`knowledge-base/`** — all-staff visible. Default surface for everyone at Pawline. Vault content (concepts, decisions, evidence, glossary, playbooks, policies, stakeholders, meetings, deliverables).
> - **`internal/`** — exec/board-only material (active M&A pipeline, compensation, vendor negotiations, exec performance, strategic pricing). Path-excluded from cortex-portal export. Never visible below Director level except by named grant.
> - The same shape that an Abeto-engagement repo uses for "client-visible vs Abeto-internal" — reframed here as "all-staff vs exec-only," which is the pattern most company KMSes need.

Nothing under `knowledge-base/` should contain unredacted comp data, named M&A targets, or active-negotiation positions. Nothing under `internal/` is exposed in the portal default render. The folder boundary IS the export boundary; cortex-portal export logic reads `knowledge-base/` and `config/` (with credential redaction) only.

## What this repo is

This is **Pawline Veterinary Partners' company-wide knowledge management system** — Cortex deployed as the institutional brain of an 80-clinic veterinary services rollup. Concepts describe how the company actually runs. Decisions are the company's own ADRs. Stakeholders are the executive team and board. Meetings are board reviews and ops cadences. Deliverables are the annual operating plan, M&A pipeline, clinical standards manual. Playbooks are how the company integrates acquisitions, opens clinics, onboards new vets. Policies are the company's clinical, DEA, privacy, and equity-vesting positions.

This repo also operates as an **Obsidian vault**. Open the repo root in Obsidian and the wiki, MOC, and Bases render natively. See `knowledge-base/CONVENTIONS.md` for the per-note frontmatter contract and `MOC.canvas` for the operating-system map.

## How to read this repo

1. **`MOC.canvas`** — operating-system map (open in Obsidian or the portal)
2. **`README.md`** — live dashboard with embedded Bases
3. **`knowledge-base/`** — all-staff vault content
   - `glossary.md` — alphabetical term index
   - `concepts/`, `decisions/`, `evidence/`, `stakeholders/`, `meetings/`, `deliverables/`, `playbooks/`, `policies/`
   - `CONVENTIONS.md` — frontmatter rules + visibility guard
4. **`internal/`** — exec/board-only material
   - `ma-pipeline/`, `compensation/`, `vendor-negotiations/`, `performance/`, `pricing/`
5. **`config/`** — system inventory, org-map, connectors, guardrails
6. **`docs/decisions/`** — vault-shape ADRs (the boundary contract itself)
7. **`docs/plans/`** — implementation plans for Cortex deployment

## What you can change without involving the CIO/CMO

- Adding or updating a playbook under `knowledge-base/playbooks/`
- Updating the glossary
- Filing evidence or new concepts under `knowledge-base/`
- Drafting a deliverable

## What requires exec sign-off

- Anything inside `internal/`
- Adding a new connector (new source system) under `config/connectors.md`
- Schema migrations in the underlying ontology
- Any decision marked `accepted` (decisions are the company's ADR layer; the named `decision_maker` signs)
